The UbiComp lab consists of an interdisciplinary team of investigators that tackle challenging research problems both from building the enabling hardware and software systems to the deployment and evaluation of these technologies in real-world settings, especially around health. We collaborate very closely with UW Professors in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and School of Medicine. In addition, we have close collaborations with Google, Microsoft Research, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Intel, Facebook, and many other companies.",
    "content": "## Requirements\n- Strong background in computer science or related fields\n- Interest in ubiquitous computing\n\n## Qualifications\n- Undergraduate or graduate students\n\nThe Ubicomp Lab offers opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research on topics like wearable computing, health sensing, and smart environments. Students can participate in ongoing projects and contribute to publications.\n\nPhD Students\n------------\nWe receive a lot of inquiries from prospective PhD students wanting to join the lab, but unfortunately we are not able to take every student. We are also not able to directly admit to the lab and students must apply and be admitted to the UW CSE or EE PhD program before we are able to make commitments to students. Students interested in joining the lab as a PhD student should contact Prof. Shwetak Patel.\nMasters Students\n----------------\nWe certainly welcome Masters students, but prioritize funding and RAs to PhD students. From time to time we may offer an RA to Masters students. However, we typically first ask Masters students to work on a small project in the lab for course credit to establish fit and confirm the studentâ€™s interest in the topic area.\nUndergraduates\n--------------\nUndergraduate research is an important part of the lab and we have a very active group of undergraduates working in the group.\nApplying\n--------\nUndergraduates and Masters students interested in conducting research in the Ubicomp lab must fill out an application before the start of the quarter during the academic year. We use the applications to keep track of everyone interested in doing research and to find project matches. Please note that we often get many more applications than positions we have, but we will try our best to find an opportunity for you.

Topics for seminar have included: guest speaker talks, discussions about research papers, mini-workshops, and more. If you would like to give a talk at the UbiComp Seminar, please contact jcao22@cs.washington.edu and we can help schedule a time.\nHigh school research opportunities\n----------------------------------\nThe Ubicomp Lab invites a select number of high school students from the Seattle area to conduct an intense 8-week long research project during the summer from July 1 - August 23. Prof. Shwetak Patel created this program because of his own participation in research when he was in high school and the incredible experience it provided for his career path.\nThe application is closed and we are not accepting late applications. We will send out decisions on May 15th.\nReceive updates\n---------------\nYou can also subscribe to the lab email list [here](https://mailman11.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/ubicomp-public) if you are interested in receiving information on the lab and research updates. We also occasionally share opportunities for people to participate in our research studies as volunteer research subjects, which are shared to that list.",
